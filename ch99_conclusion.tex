\* Do not review!

In this thesis we played with LSA
we designed a novel way how to incorporate the superwised information to LSA

first we reproduced some shit -> traind word2vec < LSA <pretrained word2vec.

We designed, implemented and evaluated a novel method eLSA 
that improves LSA accuracy.


gradient descent, experimentaly showed that it converges.

we used eLSA to analyze common word weighting schemes and mined some insight from some datasets
we identifies interesting shit that can be used for further work
